# JavaAssignment1-Stu_Mgmt_Sys
Created a mini Student Management System using Java to demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, methods, constructors, and inheritance.

This is a implementation of a Studement Management System Using CLI and using OOP principles in Java.





What Do you need?:

- VSCode, IntelliJ,Eclipse, VIM, or you may run through the terminal if you so choose.

This project was done to showcase an understanding of the following when programming in java:
- Proper OOP principles
- Proper Classes
- Use of Getters
- Use of Setters
- Arraylists
- Method Constructors
- Method Overriding


How it Works


-When the program succesfully runs, you are greeted with a message
- A menu will appear with 4 options
- Option 1: Register student with their Major, their Name, their age and address
- Option 2: Displays ALL the students registered
- Option 3: Displays a specific student if their ID matches whats in the array
- Option 4: Quits
